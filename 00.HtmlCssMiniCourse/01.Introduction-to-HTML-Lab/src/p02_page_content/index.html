        <p>This is my second blog entry, and I just wanted to check in on you. I published
            my first article about business blogging in August, 2001. You can read it here. Whew.
            A lot of water under the bridge since then, including 9/11, which happened only a few weeks later.

        <p>I'm so happy to write my first blog entry - yay! I published my first article about
            business blogging in August, 2001. You can read it here. Whew. A lot of water under
            the bridge since then, including 9/11, which happened only a few weeks later.

    <p>This paragraph is not in a header, which is in an article, which is in a section.<br>
        That's why it is not affected by the style sheet.<br>
        But if the style sheet was just for "p", then all paragraphs would be affected<br>
        including this one and the ones above.</p>
